# IBM Quantum Challenge 2020

Source code for my solutions to the [IBM Quantum Challenge](https://github.com/qiskit-community/may4_challenge_exercises)

## Exercise 1: Intro
Basic operations and Quantum Circuit manipulation using the qiskit library.

## Exercise 2: Error Mitigation
Measurement errors from energy relaxation and random sources are common in current NISQ technology. 
This excercise demonstrates the use of calibration matrices to adjust for these errors after measurement.

## Exercise 3: Quantum Cryptography
A simulation of the first proposed quantum cryptography protocol (bb84) is implemented and tested.

## Exercise 4: Circuit Decomposition
Decomposition of a Unitary matrix into a circuit of `U3` and `CX` gates within a small error margin. 
Additional constraints are encouraged to minimize gate usage and error propagation on NISQ systems.
